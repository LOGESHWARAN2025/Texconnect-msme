-- CHECK CURRENT FEEDBACK AND RATINGS
-- =====================================================

-- STEP 1: Show all feedback with ratings
SELECT 
    'üìù ALL FEEDBACK' as section,
    f.id as feedback_id,
    f.username as buyer_name,
    f.rating as stars_given,
    f.comment,
    f.productid,
    f.createdat as submitted_at
FROM feedback f
WHERE f.rating IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY f.createdat DESC;

-- STEP 2: Show which products have feedback
SELECT 
    'üîó FEEDBACK LINKED TO PRODUCTS' as section,
    p.name as product_name,
    f.username as buyer_name,
    f.rating as stars_given,
    f.createdat as when_submitted
FROM feedback f
INNER JOIN products p ON f.productid = p.id
WHERE f.rating IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY p.name, f.createdat;

-- STEP 3: Count feedback per product
SELECT 
    'üìä FEEDBACK COUNT PER PRODUCT' as section,
    p.name as product_name,
    COUNT(f.rating) as total_feedback_count,
    AVG(f.rating)::DECIMAL(3,2) as calculated_average,

    MAX(f.rating) as highest_rating
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN feedback f ON f.productid = p.id AND f.rating IS NOT NULL

-- STEP 4: Show current product ratings
SELECT

        WHEN p.totalratings > 0 THEN '‚úÖ Has ratings'
        ELSE '‚ùå No ratings'
    END as status
FROM products p

-- STEP 5: Compare calculated vs stored
SELECT

    p.name as product_name,

-- STEP 6: Summary
SELECT

    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM feedback WHERE rating IS NOT NULL) as total_feedback_submitted,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT productid) FROM feedback WHERE rating IS NOT NULL) as products_that_have_feedback;

-- STEP 7: Show what stars mean
SELECT 
    '‚≠ê STAR RATING GUIDE' as section,
    '5 stars' as rating,
    '‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê' as display,
    'Excellent' as meaning
UNION ALL

UNION ALL
SELECT '', '3 stars', '‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ', 'Average'
UNION ALL
SELECT '', '2 stars', '‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ', 'Poor'
UNION ALL
SELECT '', '1 star', '‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ', 'Very Poor';

-- STEP 8: Example of how multiple ratings work
SELECT 
    'üí° EXAMPLE: Multiple Buyers Rating Same Product' as section;

-- Show example calculation
SELECT 
    'Example Scenario' as step,
    'Buyer 1 gives 5 stars' as action,
    '5.0' as average,
    '1' as count
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    '',
    'Buyer 2 gives 4 stars',
    '(5+4)/2 = 4.5',
    '2'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    '',
    'Buyer 3 gives 5 stars',
    '(5+4+5)/3 = 4.7',

UNION ALL
SELECT
