## Current Status
‚úÖ Orders are being saved to Supabase
‚úÖ Buyer can see their orders
‚úÖ Debugging logs added
‚ùå MSME cannot see orders (filtering issue)

## Steps to Fix Everything

### 1. Run Database Setup (REQUIRED)
```sql

-- Run: COMPLETE-FIX-ALL.sql
```

This will:

**Expected logs when MSME views Orders:**
```javascript
üì¶ Raw products from database: [...]
üì¶ Mapped products: [...]
üè≠ MSME Products: { userProducts: 3 }  ‚Üê Should be > 0
üìã OrdersView: { totalOrders: 5 }      ‚Üê Should be > 0
‚úÖ Filtered MSME orders: 2             ‚Üê Should be > 0
```

### 4. Test Complete Flow

1. Login as MSME
2. Go to Products section
3. Add a product (e.g., "Cotton Fabric", Stock: 100)
4. Note the product name

## Database Tables

### orders
- Stores all orders
- JSONB items array with productId
- Triggers on status change

### products
- Finished goods for sale
- Column: `msmeid` (lowercase)
- Stock decreases on order acceptance

### inventory
- Raw materials
- Column: `msmeid` (lowercase)
- Column: `updatedat` (lowercase)
- Stock decreases on order acceptance

---

## Quick Verification

### 1. Check Database
```sql
-- Orders exist?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;

-- Products exist?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;

-- Trigger installed?
SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'order_acceptance_stock_trigger';
```

### 2. Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Products fetched?
üì¶ Raw products from database: [...]

// Orders fetched?
‚úÖ Orders fetched: 5 orders

// Filtering working?
‚úÖ Filtered MSME orders: 2
```

### 3. Check Supabase Logs
When order is accepted:
```
üîÑ Order accepted, processing stock deduction...
‚úÖ Updated product stock. New stock: 90
```

## Summary

**The system is designed to:**
1. ‚úÖ Store orders in Supabase
2. ‚úÖ Show orders to buyers (their own)
3. ‚úÖ Show orders to MSMEs (for their products)
4. ‚úÖ Automatically decrease stock on acceptance
5. ‚úÖ Update in real-time for all users

**The issue is:**
- MSME orders filtering logic needs correct product ownership matching
- Check browser console logs to see the exact issue

**Run `COMPLETE-FIX-ALL.sql` and check the console logs!**
